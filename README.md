About the algorithm: is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It begins with a node, then first traverses all its adjacent. Once all adjacent are visited, then their adjacent are traversed. This is different from DFS in a way that closest vertices are visited before others. We mainly traverse vertices level by level. A lot of popular graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path, Kahn’s Algorithm, and Prim’s algorithm are based on BFS. BFS itself can be used to detect cycle in a directed and undirected graph, find shortest path in an unweghted graph and many more problems.
